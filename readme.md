# Auth0.js Demo Login
This respository aims to provide a starting template to play around with the Auth0.js library.
## How to set up
Create a new Single Page Application in Auth0. In "static" -> "config.js", enter the domain and client id of your new application. For the database, enter the name of the Auth0 database connection that users using email and password should be verified against. 

Note: In order to use SMS passwordless authentication, you will need a valid Twilio configuration in Auth0. If you are using an existing Auth0 Demo environment (Travel0), these settings are already in place.
